## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of the package 'prepkit'. 
I have bumped the version to 0.1.1 because the server already contained the 0.1.0 artifact.

In this submission, I have addressed all previous feedback:
1. Fixed the URL in DESCRIPTION (added trailing slash to avoid 301 redirect).
2. Confirmed 'Yeo' is a surname.
3. Confirmed 'preprocessing' is a standard term.
4. Shortened the Title and cleaned up Description formatting.
