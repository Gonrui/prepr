Description: A comprehensive collection of tools for data normalization and 
    transformation in the preprocessing stage of data analysis. It provides 
    functions for various scaling methods such as min-max, Z-score, and L2 
    normalization, as well as power transformations including Box-Cox and 
    Yeo-Johnson. These methods are designed to help users prepare their 
    datasets for machine learning and statistical modeling by ensuring 
    proper data distribution and scale.
